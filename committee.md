**Kristen Vaccaro** is a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Her research focuses on designing algorithmic decision making systems for user agency and control, with two primary mechanisms of interest: control settings and contestability. Her recent work has explored designing for contestability via participatory design workshops, as well as by running large-scale online surveys that assess the effect of common contestability designs.

**Karrie Karahalios** is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, the director of the Social Spaces Group, and the co-director of the Center for People and Infrastructures. Her work focuses on the signals that people emit and perceive in social computer mediated communication.  More recently, she has explored how algorithmic curation alters these signals and people's perception of communication. Karahalios studies existing systems and builds infrastructures for new communication systems (that move control to people, allow for inferences of bias and fairness, and evaluate algorithm explainability).

**Deirdre K. Mulligan** is an Associate Professor in the School of Information at UC Berkeley, a faculty Director of the Berkeley Center for Law \& Technology, a co-organizer of the Algorithmic Fairness \& Opacity Working Group, an affiliated faculty on the Hewlett funded Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity, and a faculty advisor to the Center for Technology, Society \& Policy. Mulligan?s research explores legal and technical means of protecting values such as privacy, freedom of expression, and fairness in emerging technical systems.

**Daniel Kluttz** is a Postdoctoral Scholar at the UC Berkeley School of Information's Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Working Group (AFOG). Drawing from intellectual traditions in organizational theory, law and society, and technology studies, Kluttz's research is oriented around two broad lines of inquiry: 1) the formal and informal governance of economic and technological innovations, and 2) the organizational and legal environments surrounding such innovations. He holds a PhD in sociology from UC Berkeley and a JD from the UNC-Chapel Hill School of Law.

**Tad Hirsch** is a Professor of Art + Design at Northeastern University, where he conducts research and creative practice at the intersection of design, engineering, and social justice. He is currently developing automated assessment and training tools for addiction counseling and mental health; prior work has tackled such thorny issues as human trafficking, environmental justice, and public protest.  His pioneering work on ``Designing Contestability" identified contestability as a new principle for designing systems that evaluate human behavior.
