The list of participants and papers will be coming soon. The workshop schedule is included below, further details about activities can be found in the workshop proposal.

## Workshop's schedule 

### 08:00 - Breakfast and Introductions
Participants will meet, the schedule of the workshop will be reviewed, and all participants will introduce themselves to the group.

### 09:00 - Presentations
The early morning will feature brief presentations from a select subset of case studies, position papers, design fictions, from participants and organizers. 

### 10:30 - Breakout session I
Breakout sessions will coincide with opportunities for bio- and snack breaks. Each begins with a provocation as one potential point for discussion, but also an opportunity to engage with presenters and others who have shared thoughts of interest to them.

### 10:45 - Discussion I
Discussion as a group around a set of guiding questions. These guiding questions will be drawn from the submitted papers, but will also be solicited using hashtags on social media and directly asking invited participants before the start of the workshop. The goal of this period will be to encourage discussion to range as broadly as possible and be as participatory as possible.

### 12:00 - Lunch
Participants will share a group lunch with a discussion directed towards future research. 

### 13:00 - Interactive Activity
The early afternoon will consist of an interactive activity inspired by adversarial learning. The interactive activity addresses two goals: achieving experiential learning and having fun. This activity should both showcase frustration experienced by many users, while at the same time driving participants (though the iterative nature of the activity) to discover novel and innovative ways of engaging with a decision making system.

To that end, participants will split into two teams (A and B). Team A is confronted with an adverse decision and should contest that decision. The decision will be developed based on a case study drawn from the submissions or provided by the workshop organizers, but will also integrate elements from the earlier discussion. Team B, rather than improving the decision, should instead try to make it worse. Team A will again try to contest the decision, and Team B will again response by making the decision worse. Then the two teams will switch sides and draw on a second case study decision. 

### 14:45 - Breakout session II

### 15:00 - Discussion II
After the interactive activity, we will close with a discussion that is more narrowly focused in the late afternoon. This session will focus the discussion in particular on steps for moving forward: what are guiding principles for research in this area? And are there any steps that should be taken to make findings more accessible and useful to the general public and industry designers and developers?

These guiding questions will be drawn from the submitted papers, but will also be solicited using hashtags on social media and directly asking invited participants before the start of the workshop. The goal of this period will be to encourage discussion to range as broadly as possible and be as participatory as possible.

### 18:00 - Dinner
Participants will socialize over food and drinks for a less structured discussion.
