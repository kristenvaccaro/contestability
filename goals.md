title: Workshop Goals.
---

- **Meet colleagues and build collaborations:** Drawing researchers from multiple disciplines and methods (machine learning, HCI, law, ethics, etc.), this workshop seeks to make connections between people and groups, particularly across disciplinary boundaries.

- **Establish a set of definitions and precedents:** Using case studies and experiences drawn from historical HCI and specific domains, this workshop seeks to establish a set of definitions for the work moving forward and lay out what can be learned from prior work, as well as understand the ethical foundations of the concept of contestability. 

- **Construct a taxonomy of contestable systems:** Understand what characterizes contestable systems, as well as which systems (or types of systems) can/should be designed for contestability. 

- **Decide what's important:** Set a research agenda for future work on contestability. In doing so, this workshop will both develop a set of questions that need to be addressed and principles for how to do so.

- **Communicate beyond HCI:** This workshop looks to understand how industry, regulators, and policy can operationalize findings from this area, as well as how to draw contributions and share findings with these larger communities.
